# Godot Easy Category

A godot plugin to easily add categories to the property inspector panel. This project is inspired by https://github.com/mathewcst/godot-export-categories, but with some added customisation for my own needs.

Benefits:
- Easily customisable look via a control scene
- Uses the colours for the editor's theme to more closely match the normal category separator
- Automatic case conversion
